Agent Zero: "Eagle has landed. Awaiting further instructions. The weather here is 'sunny with a chance of rain'. Over."

Chief: "Understood, Zero. Your next move is to 'attend the gathering' at the location we discussed. Look for the 'man in red'. He holds the next piece of the puzzle. Exercise extreme caution. Trust no one. Over."

Agent Zero: "Acknowledged. The 'man in red' has been contacted. We exchanged 'stories about the weather'. I have the puzzle piece. Awaiting next steps. It appears we're not the only ones interested in 'meteorology' here. Over."

Chief: "Excellent work, Zero. Now, proceed to 'leave a mark' on the designated 'sculpture' in the park. This will signal our friends to make the next move. After that, extract yourself from the area immediately. Your next rendezvous point will be 'under the stars'. Stay sharp. The game is afoot. Over."
