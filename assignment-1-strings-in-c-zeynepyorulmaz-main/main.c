/*
In the cases of brute force, anyone can just try the 25 shift values and find the secret conversation, so it is not so effective.
Its strengths are that it is easy to encrypt and decrypt and it is fast.
Its weaknesses are it is not that secure and can be brute forced
In task5 assuming some max length in an iteration is not so efficient
I remember seeing better encryption algorithms in COMP106 last year
Where we have a very large prime number and generally do operations with modulo to encrypt and decrypt
It was called RSA algorithm: 
n = p*q (p and q are large prime numbers)
C = M^e (mod n) (M is the message, C is the encrypted message, e is the public key)
 M â‰¡ C^d (mod n)  (d is the private key)
