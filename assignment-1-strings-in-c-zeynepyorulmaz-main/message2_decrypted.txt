Agent One: "The package has been secured. Awaiting extraction coordinates. Visibility is 'limited due to fog'. Over."

Chief: "Copy that, One. Proceed to 'navigate the maze' and exit near the 'old watermill'. Your contact, 'the lady with the emerald brooch', will meet you there. She knows the safe route out. Remember, shadows are your allies tonight. Over."

Agent One: "Coordinates received. 'The lady with the emerald brooch' provided the escape route. Package is intact. However, there seems to be 'a gathering storm'â€”not just in the sky. We might have company soon. Over."

Chief: "Understood, One. With the storm as your cover, make your way to 'the abandoned lighthouse'. Leave the package in the hidden compartment at the base. Then, vanish before the storm clears. Your next contact awaits 'where the river meets the sea'. Vigilance is key. The night is dark, and full of unknowns. Over."
