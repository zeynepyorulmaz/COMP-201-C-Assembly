Operative Viper: "The hawk circles. Awaiting the signal. The air is 'thick with anticipation'. Over."

Adversary Leader: "Acknowledged, Viper. Your task is to 'disrupt the gathering' by intercepting the 'messenger with the silver cufflinks'. Ensure he never delivers his message. The night favors the bold. Over."

Operative Viper: "The 'messenger with the silver cufflinks' has been intercepted. The message will not reach its destination. However, there's 'a scent of betrayal' in the air. It seems we're not the only ones playing this game. Over."

Adversary Leader: "Well done, Viper. Now, proceed to 'cast doubt' among the ranks by leaving the forged documents in the 'safe house' they frequent. This will turn ally against ally. After completing your task, disappear into the 'fog of war'. Your next assignment will be 'where shadows dwell'. Remember, trust is a weapon as sharp as any blade. Over."
